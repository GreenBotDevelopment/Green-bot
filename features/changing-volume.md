# Changing Volume

You can controll Green-bot's volume in the voice channel using the volume command

\
To set the volume to a specific number just do `/volume number`  \
You can specify a number between 1 and 200. Low values are not recomended

If you want to increase the volume use `/volume up`, to decrease it use `/volume down`

You see the current volume by using just `/volume`
