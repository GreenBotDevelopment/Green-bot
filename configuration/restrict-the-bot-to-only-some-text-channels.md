# Restrict the bot to only some text channels

If you want to make Green-bot working only in some text channels, you can use the `/textchannels` command. The bot will only work in the text channels you'll set

#### Add a text channel to the list

To add a text channel to this list, run the following command:

Don't forget to replace "#text-channel" by your text channel. It can be the mention of the text channel only

`/textchannels #text-channel`

The channel is now in the list of the allowed text channels! You can check with the `/settings` command

#### Disable the restriction

Just do: `/textchannels #text-channel` again and the channel will be removed from the list
