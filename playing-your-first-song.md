# Playing your first song

We've tried to make things simple to use whilst also giving you control of what happens in your voice channel. To get started with playing music you must first join the voice channel of your choice.

You can search for a specific song using the `/search` command.\
If you use the `/play` command, the bot will choose the first song.

Once you've made your search, Green-bot will search your song and add it to the queue.

If Green-bot give any results, or not the results you were looking for, then please give in a more specific search term or the direct link to the song instead.

*Green-Bot search finds only songs, if you want to play a video you have to provide the link*
