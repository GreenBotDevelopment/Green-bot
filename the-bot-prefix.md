# The bot prefix

By default, Green-bot's prefix is set to `*` You can already use the bot mention or `green` as a prefix.
For an easier experience, you can use slash commands by pressing / and selecting the green-bot logo

#### What is a prefix ?

It's the character to execute commands. You can customize it with the `setprefix` command.

#### How to execute a command ?

To execute a command, first write the prefix and then the command name.&#x20;

Example: `green help`&#x20;

#### Commands arguments

Some commands may require arguments. But what are they ?

When you do `green play music` , music is the argument

{% hint style="info" %}
There must be a space between the command name and the arguments
{% endhint %}

On the command list, the arguments are between hooks such as \[] or <> .&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If an argument is surrounded in <> that means that it's required for the commands function.

If it's surrounded in \[ ] that means it's completely optional or is based on previous arguments given to run the command.
{% endhint %}

Example of command with arguments:

Play usage: `green play <song/ Url>`

How to use: `green play faded alan walker`

{% hint style="info" %}
`To get the command list, you can do the help command`
{% endhint %}
