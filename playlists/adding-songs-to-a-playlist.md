# Adding songs to a playlist

You can add songs to the playlist you created by typing the command: `/pl-add <playlist-name> <song/url>`

After typing the above command the bot should say `Successfully added x track(s) to <playlist-name>`

You can add as many songs as you like or even add a spotify playlist to your own playlist on Green-bot
